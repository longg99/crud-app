# Countries Data React App

### Live Demo: 
https://crud-app-react.herokuapp.com/

### Introduction
This is a simple CRUD app to manage a book library. It uses ReactJS on the front end with Spring Boot on the back end. There is no database used in this app,
as I am using H2 (a local storage database) for demonstration purposes.

### Dark/Light Mode
This app has a function to switch between dark and light modes. Look for a button on the top left corner to try it!

### Notes

This app is tested and working on Safari on iOS.
